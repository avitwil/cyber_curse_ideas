.TH SNMAP 1 "2025-08-21" "Version 1.0" "Super Nmap Manual"
.SH NAME
Snmap \- Advanced Python Nmap wrapper with enhanced output and JSON export

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Snmap
[\-f <file>] [\-t <ip>] [\-ts <subnet>] [\-flags <NMAP_FLAGS>] [\-\-json <file>] [\-h]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Snmap is a Python3-based wrapper around Nmap designed to simplify network scanning. 
It allows scanning single IP addresses, multiple IPs from a file, or entire subnets. 
It enhances Nmap output with colored terminal formatting, OS detection, port state, 
service details, script results, and the option to export results to JSON.

This tool is intended for security students, pentesters, and network administrators
who need fast, readable scan results with minimal manual parsing.

.SH TARGET SELECTION
.TP
\fB-f <file>\fR
Read a list of IP addresses from a file. Each IP should be on a separate line. 
Empty lines are ignored. File must exist, otherwise Snmap exits with an error.

.TP
\fB-t <ip>\fR
Scan a single target IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.10).

.TP
\fB-ts <subnet>\fR
Scan a subnet in CIDR format (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). Useful for scanning entire networks.

.SH NMAP FLAGS
.TP
\fB-flags <NMAP_FLAGS>\fR
Custom Nmap flags to use. Accepts multiple arguments, e.g., 
\(-sS -sV -O --script vuln\). If no flags are specified, a default TCP SYN scan (-sS) is used.

.SH OUTPUT OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--json <file>\fR
Export the scan results to a JSON file instead of printing to the console. 
The JSON includes structured information for each host: OS guesses, ports, and scripts.

.TP
\fB-h, --help\fR
Show a detailed help menu with usage instructions, then exit.

.SH NMAP SCAN TYPES
.TP
\fB-sS\fR
TCP SYN scan (default stealth scan). Only sends SYN packets; less likely to be logged.

.TP
\fB-sT\fR
TCP connect scan. Performs full TCP handshake; detectable by the target.

.TP
\fB-sU\fR
UDP scan. Scans for open UDP ports.

.TP
\fB-sN, -sF, -sX\fR
TCP Null, FIN, Xmas scans. Evasion scans that send unusual flags.

.TP
\fB-sA\fR
TCP ACK scan. Determines firewall rules and filtered ports.

.TP
\fB-sW\fR
TCP Window scan. Uses TCP window size to detect open/closed ports.

.TP
\fB-sM\fR
TCP Maimon scan. Advanced stealth scan using FIN/ACK packets.

.SH SERVICE AND OS DETECTION
.TP
\fB-sV\fR
Detect service version information for open ports.

.TP
\fB-O\fR
OS detection. Attempts to identify operating system based on TCP/IP stack behavior.

.TP
\fB--osscan-guess\fR
Aggressively guess OS even if initial confidence is low.

.TP
\fB-A\fR
Aggressive scan. Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

.SH PORT SPECIFICATION
.TP
\fB-p <ports>\fR
Scan specific ports or ranges (e.g., 22,80,443 or 1-1024).

.TP
\fB--top-ports <num>\fR
Scan only the top <num> most common ports.

.TP
\fB--exclude-ports <num>\fR
Exclude certain ports from scanning.

.TP
\fB-F\fR
Fast scan. Scans fewer ports for quicker results.

.SH HOST DISCOVERY AND TIMING
.TP
\fB-Pn\fR
Treat all hosts as online. Skips host discovery; useful for stealth scanning.

.TP
\fB-n\fR
Do not resolve DNS names.

.TP
\fB-R\fR
Always resolve DNS names, even if the target is already an IP.

.TP
\fB-T0..T5\fR
Timing templates (0 slowest, 5 fastest). Higher speeds may trigger IDS/IPS alerts.

.SH NMAP SCRIPTS
.TP
\fB--script <scripts>\fR
Run Nmap scripts to automate tasks like vulnerability scanning, auth checks, or safe checks.
Examples: vuln, default, safe, auth.

.SH OTHER USEFUL FLAGS
.TP
\fB--open\fR
Show only open ports in the results.

.TP
\fB-v\fR
Increase verbosity. Shows more scanning progress.

.TP
\fB-d\fR
Enable debug output for troubleshooting.

.TP
\fB--reason\fR
Display the reason a port is in a particular state (e.g., filtered, closed).

.TP
\fB--version\fR
Show Nmap version.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fBSnmap -f ips.txt\fR
Scan multiple targets listed in "ips.txt".

.TP
\fBSnmap -t 192.168.1.10 -flags -sV\fR
Scan a single host with service version detection.

.TP
\fBSnmap -ts 192.168.1.0/24 -flags -A --open\fR
Aggressive scan of a subnet, showing only open ports.

.TP
\fBSnmap -t 10.0.0.5 --json results.json\fR
Scan a single IP and save results to a JSON file.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
Results are displayed per host:
.IP
1. Host IP
.IP
2. OS guesses with accuracy
.IP
3. Port table: protocol, port, state, service, product, version, reason
.IP
4. Scripts run per port with output

.SH ERRORS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
.TP
\fBFileNotFoundError\fR
Raised if the file specified with -f does not exist.

.TP
\fBNo targets specified\fR
Occurs if no -f, -t, or -ts argument is provided.

.TP
\fBScan errors\fR
Network issues or permissions may prevent scanning. Ensure Nmap is installed and run as root if necessary for some scan types.
